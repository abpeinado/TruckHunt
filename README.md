## Data

Truck schedules and permit information comes from [SF Open Data], which publishes a variety of data for mobile food vendors in SF.

If you are interested in testing and developement you can find sample data in JSON format within [database/data](database/data).  Once you have installed PostgreSQL you must seed the database. See Database section below. 

## Tech Stack
  - [React] with [React-Router] & [Redux]
  - [Node] & [Express]
  - [PostgreSQL] with [pg-promise]
  - [Semantic-UI-React]
  - [Jest] with [Supertest] & [Enzyme]

## Payments

This application utilizes the Stripe API to allow payments for both vendors and customers. Stripe allows charging and paying customers in a variety of formats without payment information ever touching the server; https encryption is all that is required. For those interested in using this repo for their own project please register your app with Stripe to obtain your own API keys, which you can store in your .env file (private keys) and in the webpack environmentplugin (public keys). 

## Database

This application uses a PostgreSQL database to access vendor and customer information. 

To install postgres locally on OSX:
brew tap homebrew/services
brew install postgres
brew services start postgresql
createdb toads

Once you've created your db run "npm run start-dev" to create all the db tables. Next navigate to the seedDatabase folder and run 

node seedVendors.js
node seedSchedules.js.
node seedMenus.js
node seedReviews.js.  

This will populate your local db with real food-truck data and allow trucks to properly rendor on the map. The menu and review data is dummy data as we are currently building out functionality to allow vendors to upload their menus and customers to review trucks.

If you decide to modify the schema you must run "dropdb toads" followed by the steps above.
